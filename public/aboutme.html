<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Well, that's certainly good to know. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. 
    Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! They were just sucked 
    into space. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern 
    is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to 
    that of lieutenant? Sorry, Data. Some days you get the bear, and some days 
    the bear gets you.Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one 
    of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural 
    pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. When has 
    justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Travel time to the nearest 
    starbase? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, 
    I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I'll alert the crew.
    Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?

<p>We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Yesterday I did not 
    know how to eat gagh. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for 
    an instant to be in two places at once. Congratulations - you just destroyed 
    the Enterprise. They were just sucked into space. Did you come here for 
    something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Mr. Worf, you do 
    remember how to fire phasers? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes 
    with Geordi, or Worf. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your 
    only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of 
    prisoner to that of lieutenant? In all trust, there is the possibility for 
    betrayal.
